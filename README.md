- I created 5 NBA teams using records.
- Each team has a name, a coach, and win/loss stats.
- I filtered the teams to show only successful ones (wins > losses).
- Then I calculated the success percentage for each team.

2. ValentinesBudget.fsx

- I used discriminated unions to define different activities for Valentine's Day.
- Activities include: board game, chill, watch a movie, restaurant, and long drive.
- Each activity has a specific cost:
Movies and restaurants have different prices.
- Long drive cost is based on distance and fuel rate.


  Contributions - I just use the chat gpt to get the idea on records Calculate success percentages.
